### :zap:Sorting Algorithm Visualiser
![Demo] (Demo/React-App-Google-Chrome-2020-07.gif)

## :sparkles:Contents and Algorithms
There are 4 views included , the Home page , Theory page , Practice Page and Visualiser Page. The Theory and Practice page provide related and brief study material and to do questions for some selected algorithms like bubble sort , merge sort , insertion sort , heap sort , Dijkstra shortest path algorithm.
The visualiser helps in better understanding these algorithms , currently it has merge sort and bubble sort visualisers only.

## :question:How to Use:

* On the Theory and Practice page , there is a side navbar with algorithms name on it.
* Choose the algorithm you want and the content related to it will be rendered.
* For the visualiser , create a new array which will be sorted , by clicking on **Generate New Array** button.
* Pick the desired algorithm.
* The array will be sorted according to the chosen algorithm , with the indices being compared int one color ,initial array in another , and final array in a different one.

## :anger:To-do:
- [ ] update UI
- [ ] Add more Practice problems to each category
- [ ] Add Path Finding Visualiser
- [ ] Add *size and range of array* feature
